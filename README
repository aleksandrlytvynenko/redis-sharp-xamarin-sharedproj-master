This is a crude proof of concept connecting to Redis using Xamarin.iOS and 
Xamarin.Droid through use of a shared project.  The shared project is 
based on a Fork of Miguel de Icaza's redis-sharp and rfranke's pubsub addition to it.

To do quick test…

Get the IP address of your local machine. Set the host variable to your IP address.  

Run redis-server

Subscribe to a channel called foo…
Run redis-cli:  SUBSCRIBE foo

Monitor your redis server’s activity…
Run another redis-cli:  MONITOR

When you run the iOS / Android project they set a key value pair identifying themselves “iOS / Android was here”, then they subscribe to a channel called foo.  You can see that in the cli running MONITOR.

See if the app receives a message…
Run another redis-cli:  PUBLISH foo “CLI was here”

You should see this message logged in your Application Output window in Xamarin Studio.

This is a C#/.NET client binding for the Redis server:

     http://code.google.com/p/redis/

The code is licensed under the same terms that the Redis server is, the new BSD license

The binding lives in the redis-sharp.cs file, a sample test file can be found on test.cs
